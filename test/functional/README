In the test_env.json file,

    *  Replace angle-bracketed data locations with required IP Addresses.
    *  Change any other default data as needed.

All the tests under test/functional dir need to be run with the pytest symbols plugin.

Install the pytest_symbols plugin, this is also added to the requirement.func.test.txt:

    https://bldr-git.int.lineratesystems.com/tools/pytest-symbols

After configuring the environmental data in test_env.json,
execute those tests similar to this:

    py.test --symbols ./test_env.json -sv -- .
