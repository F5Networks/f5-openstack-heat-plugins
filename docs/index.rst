F5 OpenStack Heat Plugins Documentation
=======================================

Introduction
------------
This repository houses all of F5's `Openstack Heat <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat>`__
resource plugins. F5's Heat plugins can be used to orchestrate BIG-IP services
in your OpenStack environment.

Installation
------------
The heat plugins need to be installed on the machine that the Heat engine is
running on in order to use templates that refer the the F5 plugins.  After
installin the plugins the Heat engine must be restarted for them to take
effect.

Ubuntu
~~~~~~
.. code:: shell

   $ pip install f5-openstack-heat-plugins
   $ service heat-engine restart

RedHat/CentOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: shell

   $ pip install f5-openstack-heat-plugins
   $ systemctl restart openstack-heat-engine.service

Usage
-----
Once the plugins are installed the F5 objects can be used when creating Heat
templates.  An example use of one of the objects is below.
