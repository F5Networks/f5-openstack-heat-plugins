This repository houses all of F5®'s OpenStack Heat resource plugins. F5's Heat plugins can be used to orchestrate BIG-IP® services in your OpenStack environment.

Releases and Versions
---------------------
This branch supports the OpenStack Kilo release.

Please see `F5 OpenStack Releases, Versioning, and Support Matrix <http://f5-openstack-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/releases_and_versioning.html>`_ for additional information about F5's OpenStack plugins and BIG-IP compatibility.

Documentation

Build
`````
To make a PyPI package...

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py sdist

Test
````
Before you open a pull request, your code must have passing `pytest <http://pytest.org>`_ unit tests. In addition, you should include a set of functional tests written to use a real BIG-IP device for testing. Information on how to run our set of tests is included below.

Unit Tests
~~~~~~~~~~
We use pytest for our unit tests.

#. If you haven't already, install the project requirements in your virtual environment.

    .. code:: shell

       pip install hacking pytest pytest-cov
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       pip install -r requirements.unit.test.txt

#. Run the tests and produce a coverage report. The ``--cov-report=html`` will create a ``htmlcov/`` directory that you can view in your browser to see the missing lines of code.

   .. code:: shell

       py.test --cov f5_heat/resources/test --cov-report=html
       open htmlcov/index.html


Functional Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Pytest is also used for functional tests

#. If you haven't already, install requirements.func.test.txt in your virtual environment.

   .. code:: shell

       pip install -r requirements.func.test.txt

#. Currently, you must modify ``test/functional/test_variables.py`` file to provide the proper credentials to Openstack. See that file for more info on what is needed. Also remember not to include this file in your pull request, since it may contiain sensitive information.

#. Run the functional tests and pass in arguments to connect to the F5 device.

   .. code:: shell

       py.test test/functional/ --bigip=<bigip_ip> --bigip-username=<web_login_username> --bigip-passwword=<web_login_password>

Style Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~
We use the hacking module for our style checks (installed as part of step 1 in the Unit Test section).

.. code:: shell

    flake8 ./
